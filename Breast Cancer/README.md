# Breast Cancer prediction  
This breast cancer domain was obtained from the University Medical Centre,
   Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.  Thanks go to M. Zwitter and 
   M. Soklic for providing the data [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer)   
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has recurrence breast cancer, a binary classification
problem given these medical details.

I preprocessed the data, wrote Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch using Python, and compared the result from 
my code with Logistic Regression from sklearn library.
