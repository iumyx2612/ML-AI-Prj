# Face Anti Spoofing
## Description  
A project I got from my school lab  
Face Anti-Spoofing attack using Neural Network instead of hand-crafted features  
## Dataset  
[NUAA Imposter Dataset](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/02/db/731/template731/pages/xtan/NUAAImposterDB_download.html)  
[CelebA-Spoof dataset](https://github.com/Davidzhangyuanhan/CelebA-Spoof)  
The training data consists of nearly 10k images which I took from those 2 datasets above  
If you want to use your own dataset without pre-cropped face images, check out [PrepareData.py](https://github.com/iumyx2612/ML-AI-Prj/blob/main/Anti-Spoofing/utillib/PrepareData.py)
